Inspired by work of _Hermann Ebbinghaus_, _Piotr Wozniak_, and _Peter Bienstman_, **memorybank** is a scheduled activity that students engage in to review items that they have learned. The goal is maximizing retention in an optimally efficient manner. Intervals between item exposure is adjusted as appropriate, with students assessing their recollection level of each item, thus allowing the best scheduling of subsequent reviews. Because it is incorporated into the Moodle learning management system, progress can be efficiently monitored and adjusted and review can be incorporated in a way that maximizes learning and retention.
